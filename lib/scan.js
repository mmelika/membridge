// Provenance reconciliation — the settle pass: the post-commit hook records a
// LOCAL commit provisionally (sessions:[], provisional:true, see
// lib/hooks.js) because it cannot safely attribute against state.json at
// commit time. The daemon is the authority instead: once it can PROVE its
// view of the relevant evidence is complete, it re-runs attributeCommit over
// fresh events and appends a settled row (provisional:false) —
// loadCommitMap's dedupe then always prefers it over the stale provisional
// one, never the other way around (see commitRank in lib/commits.js).
//
// What "caught up" actually means — the guarantee is PER SESSION FILE, not
// global. A single session's events come from its own JSONL file(s), read
// sequentially by byte offset (readNewLines above): WITHIN one session, a
// scanned event at time T proves every earlier event of that session was
// scanned too. ACROSS sessions there is no such order — files are discovered
// and drained independently, so session C's event from five seconds after
// the commit can be scanned while session B's edit from two seconds before
// it still sits unread in B's own file. A global newest-event-ts gate is
// therefore unsound: an unrelated session's newer event says NOTHING about
// whether the committing session's edits were scanned, and settling on it
// would permanently credit whatever stale evidence happens to be in state
// (or settle unattributed). Hence two gates:
//
//   • Settle ATTRIBUTED (attributeCommit credits session S) — fast path:
//     when S's OWN newest scanned event is newer than the commit, settle at
//     once — the per-session sequential-read guarantee proves S's evidence
//     at or before the commit is complete. While S's own events do NOT yet
//     pass the commit, stay provisional — S's still-unscanned edits are
//     exactly the pending evidence — BUT with a bounded escape: once the
//     GLOBAL newest scanned event is more than SETTLE_GRACE_MS past the
//     commit, settle WITH the current attribution (to S). Without the
//     escape, a session whose LAST act was the commit (edits scanned, then
//     commit, then the chat ends — the normal review-and-commit workflow)
//     could never satisfy the own-event gate: the row would stay pending
//     forever, and worse, once the bounded events window eventually evicted
//     S's edits, attributeCommit would credit nobody and the no-candidate
//     grace below would settle the row PERMANENTLY unattributed — destroying
//     provenance the daemon had already scanned. The escape is sound by the
//     same drain-lag argument the unattributed grace already accepts: a
//     grace window of data time vastly precedes event-cap eviction (hundreds
//     of events), so the escape converts "never settles / eventually wrong"
//     into "settles with the scanned attribution within one grace window".
//     NOTE the escape formally widens the documented A-active residual: past
//     the grace window a stale same-file session can be settled-credited
//     without any post-commit event of its own while the true author's file
//     still lags — but that now requires the author's file to lag a full
//     grace window of data time, which the same drain-lag analysis bounds
//     as far rarer than the every-commit starvation the escape removes.
//   • Settle UNATTRIBUTED (attributeCommit credits nobody): there is no
//     candidate whose file order can prove anything, so wait out the same
//     grace window — settle only once the newest scanned event (any
//     session) is more than SETTLE_GRACE_MS past the commit ts. The window
//     bounds the cross-file scan race (how far one session file's draining
//     can lag another's); it is deterministic — it compares two DATA
//     timestamps (event ts vs commit ts), never the wall clock, so a pass
//     replayed over the same data always decides the same way.
//
// Clock-corruption clamp: every gate above runs on DATA timestamps, so one
// corrupt event ts far in the future would satisfy every grace comparison
// instantly and void the window's protection (premature unattributed — or,
// via the escape, premature attributed — settling). Events whose ts claims
// to be more than SETTLE_TS_SANITY_MS in the future of the machine's OWN
// WALL CLOCK are ignored by the settle gates entirely — they still exist
// for attribution content, just not as catch-up proof. The anchor is the
// wall clock, never the pending commits' ts (see the constant's comment):
// past-tense events are always sane, no matter how long after the last
// commit they arrive.
//
// A commit with NO qualifying evidence yet simply stays provisional and is
// retried next pass — never force-settled, because "nothing matched so far"
// is indistinguishable from "not scanned yet".
//
// Runs every tick, independent of whether HEAD moved this tick — a
// provisional row can be left over from a commit the cursor already passed
// in an earlier pass — but costs nothing beyond one loadCommitMap (a plain
// fs read, no git) when there is nothing provisional, and calls git only for
// rows that are actually ready to settle. So the unchanged-HEAD tick's
// "avoid git entirely" cheapness is preserved for the common case (no
// provisional rows at all), while a provisional row is no longer starved by
// the unchanged-HEAD skip.
//
// Authorship gate: NOT re-checked here. The hook only ever writes a
// provisional row for a commit that already passed the local-committer gate
// (a foreign commit is recorded settled-unattributed immediately, never
// provisional — see lib/hooks.js) — so by construction nothing this function
// finds provisional can be a foreign commit. Re-deriving the gate answer
// here would also be the wrong call to make TWICE: "is this the local
// identity" is a fact about who committed, fixed at record time, not
// something further scanning could change.
//
// Best-effort: any error (a bad commits.jsonl read, a git failure inside
// readCommit/attributeCommit) is caught per-row and logged — one bad
// provisional row must never abort settling the rest, or throw into
// syncOnce.

// How far (in DATA time: newest scanned event ts past the commit ts) the
// daemon must see before "no session touched these files" becomes a
// settleable answer rather than a scan-race guess. 15 minutes comfortably
// exceeds how long one session file's draining realistically lags another's
// (every file is re-walked each sync tick), while still settling a genuinely
// unattributable commit promptly.

// anchor is the WALL CLOCK, deliberately not the newest pending commit's ts:
