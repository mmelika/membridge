# Changelog

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-13

- **Invite links (team schema v2)**: `membridge team invite` mints a short
  URL-safe token — shareable as `https://<web app>/join/<token>` or
  `membridge join <token>` — with optional expiry (`--expires-days`) and use
  cap (`--max-uses`), revocable with `team revoke-invite`. A redeem can never
  grant more than the member role; rotating the legacy code also revokes all
  outstanding links. The legacy UUID invite code keeps working — `join`
  routes on the input's shape. (`supabase/migrations/002_team_v2.sql` — a
  migration, so the live backend upgrades without recreating anything.)
- **`membridge join <link-or-code>`**: one command from invite to member —
  logs in, or creates the account if it's new (`--email` / `--password`),
  then joins. The dashboard's team page gains a "Copy invite link" button.
- **Auto-link, prompt-first**: when a local project's normalized git remote
  matches a project a teammate already shares, MemBridge *suggests* the link
  (dashboard card + log line) and shares nothing until you confirm. Opt into
  fully automatic linking with `"team": { "autoLink": true }` in config.
- **Roles & management**: `admin` role between owner and member; RPCs for
  remove_member, set_role, rename_team, rotate_invite, leave_team with
  owner/admin checks; `team_feed` (keyset pagination + person/project/tool
  filters) and a `project_stats` view power the web app in one query.
- **Hosted web workspace (`web/`)**: Next.js + supabase-js + Tailwind, no
  custom API server — RLS is the authorization layer. Screens: `/join/<token>`
  invite landing (team name via `peek_invite`, inline signup, auto-join,
  CLI install nudge), day-grouped team feed with filters, project cards,
  team settings (members, roles, invite links, rename, leave). Deploys to
  Vercel from the `web/` folder; the npm package still ships without it.
- **Privacy hardening**: memory entries now fall back to the *basename* for
  files outside the project (an absolute path would leak usernames and
  machine layout to teammates), and a regression test pins that git remote
  credentials (`https://user:token@…`) are stripped before any URL is
  uploaded. The suite grows to 82 offline checks.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-07-12

- **Team sync is now zero-config for users.** The Supabase backend is baked
  into the build (`lib/backend.json`, filled once by whoever operates the
  MemBridge backend), so end users no longer run `team setup` — they just
  `membridge signup` and go. `team setup` remains as an advanced override for
  self-hosting your own backend. (Backend resolution order: env → config →
  baked default.)

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-12

- **Team sync (beta)**: link a project to a team and every member's MemBridge
  pushes its redacted per-project memory entries to a shared Supabase backend
  (yours — run `supabase/schema.sql` in a free project) and pulls teammates'
  entries down. The injected context block gains a "Teammates' AI activity"
  section with author attribution, so your Claude Code knows what a
  teammate's Codex did. New commands: `team setup/create/join/link/unlink/
  list`, `signup`, `login`, `logout`. Invite-code joins; clones map to one
  project row via the normalized git remote (name fallback). Row-level
  security restricts every row to team members; only already-redacted digest
  entries ever leave the machine, and only for explicitly linked projects.
  Auth tokens live in `~/.membridge/credentials.json` (chmod 600). Team sync
  is best-effort on top of local sync: an unreachable backend never blocks
  local syncing. (New: `lib/teamsync.js`, `supabase/schema.sql`; the suite
  gains an offline mock Supabase and now has 60 checks.)

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-12

- **Roadmaps (the BYOK upgrade)**: with a key saved, every project's Plan tab
  becomes a generator — describe what you want to build, see the estimated
  cost before you click, and get back a phased roadmap where every task
  carries the AI model that should do it (Everyday — Haiku up to Frontier —
  Fable, plus a cross-check by Codex), a reason, and a size. The tab lists
  exactly what leaves the machine (project name, goal, redacted recent asks,
  file paths, top-level names — never file contents), shows the actual cost
  from usage afterwards, warns when new AI activity postdates the plan, and
  saves to `.membridge/plan.json`. One line — "Current roadmap: …" — is
  written into the shared memory block, so Claude Code and Codex see the
  plan too. (New: `POST /api/plan/generate`; structured-outputs request in
  `lib/advisor.js` with one retry and a 60s timeout.)
- **Settings + bring-your-own-key**: a gear in the header opens Settings —
  paste an Anthropic API key (stored only in `~/.membridge/config.json`,
  chmod 600, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env honored as fallback) with a Test button
  that makes a single count_tokens request; pick the planner model in plain
  English (Fast & cheap ~1¢ / Smarter ~4¢ / Deepest ~6¢ per roadmap); and
  set the sync interval and context files, which used to require editing
  config by hand. Interval changes now apply without restarting the daemon.
  (New: `lib/advisor.js`, `GET/POST /api/settings`, `POST /api/settings/test`;
  the key is never sent to the dashboard page.)
- **Project pages**: the Overview is now a clean projects grid (name, tool
  badges, last activity, paused state) and clicking a card opens a full
  project page — Activity (the complete ask-by-ask history with the files
  each ask touched) and Memory (what gets injected where, a read-only view
  of the full memory log, pause/resume/delete). ✕, Esc and browser-back all
  exit. (New endpoints: `GET /api/project`, `GET /api/project/memory`.)
- **Neural map**: a second dashboard tab with a force-directed 3D map of
  every chat across every project, linked by shared files and TF-IDF idea
  similarity. Events now carry per-chat session ids (state v2 triggers a
  one-time full rescan from the transcripts). (New: `lib/graph.js`,
  `GET /api/graph`.)
- **Copy for AI**: every project page has a Copy for AI button that puts a
  trimmed, redacted digest of recent AI activity on the clipboard, ready to
  paste into ChatGPT / claude.ai / any web AI that can't see your disk. The
  manual bridge until importers/MCP land. (New endpoint:
  `POST /api/projects/copy`.)
- Fix: a fast `stop` → `start` could leave the new daemon running with a dead
  dashboard when the port was still held by the dying process. The dashboard
  now retries the bind (EADDRINUSE) for up to ~10s before giving up, and says
  so in the log if it does.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-07-10

- Fix: macOS build was reported as "damaged" and refused to launch on
  Apple Silicon. Root cause: the app had zero code signature, and arm64
  Gatekeeper reports fully unsigned apps as damaged instead of the usual
  unidentified-developer warning. The build now ad-hoc signs the app
  bundle after packaging (`scripts/afterPack.js`). Still unsigned by a
  real Apple Developer certificate, so first launch needs right-click > Open.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-10

- **Tray app**: MemBridge now runs as a macOS menu-bar app (dock-hidden) and
  Windows/Linux system-tray app. Status at a glance, open dashboard, sync now,
  pause, start at login, quit. Built with Electron; the CLI daemon is unchanged
  and the app takes over cleanly if the CLI daemon is already running.
- **Per-project memory database**: every AI update is recorded as a structured
  entry in `<project>/.membridge/memory.json` — what was asked, by which tool,
  and exactly which files it touched — rendered for humans and agents as
  `.membridge/memory.md`. The DB also maintains an index of the project's
  local files (path, size, mtime; ignore-aware, capped) so memory entries can
  point any other LLM at the right files.
- The injected context block now links to `.membridge/memory.md` for the full
  log; `membridge remove` also deletes the `.membridge` folder.
- macOS app builds (unsigned `.dmg` / `.zip`) are produced by CI on every
  release via the "Build app" workflow.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-09

Initial release.

- Background daemon syncing a brief per-project "shared AI memory" into
  `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` (configurable targets)
- Adapters: Claude Code, Codex, plus a config-driven custom adapter for any
  JSONL-logging tool
- Incremental transcript reading (byte offsets, partial-write safe)
- Local web dashboard on `127.0.0.1:7437` (status, per-project memory,
  pause/resume, sync now)
- Secret redaction before injection; per-project exclude / `.membridge-off`
- `remove` command strips injected blocks cleanly
- Autostart at login on Windows, macOS, Linux (no admin required)
- Zero runtime dependencies; Node 18+; 20-check end-to-end test suite
